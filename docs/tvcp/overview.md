# VATSSA Transfer and Visiting Policy

## 1. VATSIM Policies

- This policy should be read in conjunction with any applicable VATSIM policy.

## 2. Definitions

- **Transfer**: A person wishing to permanently transfer to another Region or Division so that their relationship with the old Division ceases and the new Division becomes their registered home Division.
- **Visiting Controller**: A person who wishes to control in another Division whilst retaining the permanent relationship with their existing home Division.

## 3. Transfers to VATSSA

### 3.1 Eligibility & Restrictions (by rating)

- **OBS rating**
  - A VATSIM member may transfer to VATSSA with an OBS rating as long as they have not transferred Region or Division within the last 90 days.
- **S1 or above**
  - A VATSIM member may transfer to VATSSA with a controller rating of S1 or above as long as they have not transferred Region or Division within the last 90 days.
