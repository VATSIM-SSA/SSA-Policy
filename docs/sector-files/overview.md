# VATSSA Sector File Policy

**Valid from:** 15 June 2022

> _This document should be read in conjunction with any applicable VATSIM policy._

---

## 1. Sector Files

- **ACC Sector Files** are produced at **gng.aero-nav.com**.
- **FSS Sector Files** are currently produced by **VATSSA**.
- Division ownership of ACC and FSS sector files lies with **VATSSA1**, but the **Sector File Manager** is responsible for developing the sector files.

### 1.1 Modifications & Change Control

- **Ground layouts** may be freely changed without notice.
- **‘V’ locations** may be freely amended.
- **‘G’ locations** may **not** be amended without prior agreement from adjacent ACCs.
- Changes to **position naming** must be notified to **VATSSA1** at least **7 days** before implementation (due to website routines related to controller currency).
- Changes to **frequencies**—including additions or removals—**must be approved** by **VATSSA1** before implementation (necessary to properly update “Audio For VATSIM”).
- Changes to **sector ownership** or definitions for CTR or APP positions must be provided at least **2 weeks** before implementation, to allow updating of FSS sector files.

### 1.2 Update Frequency

- To prevent controllers from using outdated sector files, typically only **one sector file change** should be made per **AIRAC cycle**.
- Each sector file should ordinarily be **updated at least once every 3 AIRAC cycles**.

## 2. Audio For VATSIM (AFV)

- All changes to **AFV** within the VATSSA region must be implemented by **VATSSA1** or their delegate.
- Members granted access to AFV **must not** use it for VATSSA operations unless authorized—this ensures oversight and consistency across the Division.
