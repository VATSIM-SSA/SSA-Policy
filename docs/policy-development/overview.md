## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the framework by which policies within VATSIM Sub-Sahara Africa (VATSSA) are proposed, developed, reviewed, approved, published, and maintained.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All VATSSA policies, procedures, standards, and directives intended for publication as official VATSSA policy
