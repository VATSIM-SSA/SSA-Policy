## 3. Trainees

1. Training is delivered by mentors; if none are available, qualified VATSSA staff may step in. Mentors train up to their current rating (e.g., S2 mentors train S1 or S2) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
2. Visiting controllers cannot be trained above their current rating :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
3. Trainees must use vatssa.com and the VATSSA Discord server for all training-related activities :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
4. To register: Go to **Controllers → Register for Training** on vatssa.com. Placement on a waiting list follows :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
5. When promoted from the waiting list, trainees are notified—typically via Discord :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
6. A theoretical exam (pass mark: 80%) is mandatory before the Competency Practical Test (CPT). It’s administered via Moodle (moode.vatssa.com), with a 24-hour cooldown for failures :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
7. To book sessions, trainees must submit availability under **Your Training Availability**. Active engagement boosts selection chances. Inactivity for 30 days risks removal from the list :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
8. Missing a confirmed session requires at least 24 hours’ notice to the mentor; failure may result in training withdrawal :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
9. Preference may be given to trainees who address division shortfalls :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.
10. Minimum controlling hours required before moving up rating:

| New Rating | Requirement                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S2**     | ≥ 20 hours as S1 (must include VATSSA positions)                                                                                |
| **S3**     | ≥ 30 hours as S2 (minimum 25 hours on VATSSA positions)                                                                         |
| **C1**     | ≥ 50 hours as S3 (minimum 40 hours on VATSSA positions)                                                                         |
| **C3**     | ≥ 250 hours post-C1 with ≥ 50 hours each on specific Area CTRs: HKNA_CTR, DNKK_CTR, FASA_CTR (note FASA includes FAJA and FACA) |

— These must be completed before joining the training waiting list :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}.

- **Overland FSS (AFRx_FSS)** roles require a C1 rating plus extra training :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.

- Experienced mentors may serve as examiners for CPTs, but should have no more than two prior sessions with the candidate (exceptions at ATC Training Manager’s discretion) :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.
- The **Training Requested** tab shows trainee requests in chronological order, with links to training history and notes :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.

## 9. Examination Process (CPT)

1. Once ready for solo network practice, the trainee may be awarded a solo endorsement by the ATC Training Manager or Training Centre Manager via vatssa.com :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}.

   - Applies to a **single position only** (e.g., HKJK_TWR).
   - Valid for up to **30 days**, with a maximum of **three endorsements** (max 90 days).
   - The final endorsement requires consultation with the ATC Training Manager :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}.
   - Applicable for **S2, S3, or C1 ratings only** :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}.

2. When ready for CPT, submit a request via vatssa.com → Staff → Request CPT, including:

   - Candidate’s name and CID
   - Rating to be assessed
   - Proposed date & time (UTC, with 7 days' notice)
   - Preferred examiner’s name and CID (if pre-arranged)
   - Proposed facility (e.g., FACT_TWR) :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}.

3. The ATC Training Manager reviews training records and responds promptly :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}.

4. The theoretical exam for the target rating **must be completed** via Moodle before the CPT request :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}.

5. CPT structure:

   - Intro and confirmation of position/rating
   - Practical session (60–120 minutes)
   - Brief break (≤10 minutes)
   - Theoretical questions
   - Result and debrief :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}

6. On failure, the examiner provides reasons and communicates retraining needs to the ATC Training Manager and Training Centre Instructor :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}.

7. Assessments for S2, S3, and C1 must occur in live environments; traffic should be requested via Discord. A Supervisor broadcast may be issued to attract traffic :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}.

8. S1 assessments may use any method (live or sweatbox) :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}.

9. If traffic is insufficient, the CPT should be rescheduled or moved to a busier location. Sweatbox may be used at the ATC Training Manager’s discretion :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}.

10. The candidate must provide top-down service on at least one level below their rating (e.g., an S3 must handle TWR along with TMA duties). Examiners may waive this under heavy traffic conditions :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}.
