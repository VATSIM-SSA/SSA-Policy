---

## 3. Trainees

1. Training is delivered by mentors; if none are available, qualified VATSSA staff may step in. Mentors train up to their current rating (e.g., S2 mentors train S1 or S2).
2. Visiting controllers cannot be trained above their current rating.
3. Trainees must use vatssa.com and the VATSSA Discord server for all training-related activities.
4. To register: Go to **Controllers → Register for Training** on vatssa.com. Placement on a waiting list follows.
5. When promoted from the waiting list, trainees are notified—typically via Discord.
6. A theoretical exam (pass mark: 80%) is mandatory before the Competency Practical Test (CPT). It’s administered via Moodle (moode.vatssa.com), with a 24-hour cooldown for failures.
7. To book sessions, trainees must submit availability under **Your Training Availability**. Active engagement boosts selection chances. Inactivity for 30 days risks removal from the list.
8. Missing a confirmed session requires at least 24 hours’ notice to the mentor; failure may result in training withdrawal.
9. Preference may be given to trainees who address division shortfalls.
10. Minimum controlling hours required before moving up rating:

| New Rating | Requirement                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S2**     | ≥ 20 hours as S1 (must include VATSSA positions)                                                                                |
| **S3**     | ≥ 30 hours as S2 (minimum 25 hours on VATSSA positions)                                                                         |
| **C1**     | ≥ 50 hours as S3 (minimum 40 hours on VATSSA positions)                                                                         |
| **C3**     | ≥ 250 hours post-C1 with ≥ 50 hours each on specific Area CTRs: HKNA_CTR, DNKK_CTR, FASA_CTR (note FASA includes FAJA and FACA) |

— These must be completed before joining the training waiting list.

- **Overland FSS (AFRx_FSS)** roles require a C1 rating plus extra training.

## 4. Mentors

- Selected by the ATC Training Manager and approved via vatssa.com; mentors then get access to a dedicated tab on the site.
- May train up to their current rating level.
- Experienced mentors may serve as examiners for CPTs, but should have no more than two prior sessions with the candidate (exceptions at ATC Training Manager’s discretion).
- The **Training Requested** tab shows trainee requests in chronological order, with links to training history and notes.
- Training sessions must be logged via **Mentors → Log Session** on vatssa.com. Mentors should keep personal notes. Unapproved training (e.g., outside sweatbox/live traffic) is not allowed.
- Mentors should conduct at least one session per month—absence may lead to removal from the mentor list.
- They must represent VATSSA and VATSIM professionally and report any disciplinary actions to the ATC Training Manager, who will review their status.

---

## 5. ATC Training Manager

- Appointed by the Division Director. Holds overall responsibility for ATC training in the Division.
- May revoke trainee or mentor status at any time without notice; decisions can be appealed to the Division Director.

---

## 6. Assistant ATC Training Manager

- Appointed by the ATC Training Manager.
- Maintains student waiting lists, coordinates training availability, and updates the Division Director and ATC Training Manager on training wait times.

---

## 7. Training Centre Instructor

- Appointed by the ATC Training Manager. Must hold an **I1 rating**.
- Oversees training within their centre, monitors mentor and controller competency, maintains training documentation, and trains new mentors.

---

## 8. Use of Sweatbox and Live Traffic

- Preferred training takes place in live traffic; sweatbox may be used for initial familiarisation or when traffic is insufficient.
- Mentors can request additional traffic via the VATSSA Discord server when needed.

---

## 9. Examination Process (CPT)

1. Once ready for solo network practice, the trainee may be awarded a solo endorsement by the ATC Training Manager or Training Centre Manager via vatssa.com.

   - Applies to a **single position only** (e.g., HKJK_TWR).
   - Valid for up to **30 days**, with a maximum of **three endorsements** (max 90 days).
   - The final endorsement requires consultation with the ATC Training Manager.
   - Applicable for **S2, S3, or C1 ratings only**.

2. When ready for CPT, submit a request via vatssa.com → Staff → Request CPT, including:

   - Candidate’s name and CID
   - Rating to be assessed
   - Proposed date & time (UTC, with 7 days' notice)
   - Preferred examiner’s name and CID (if pre-arranged)
   - Proposed facility (e.g., FACT_TWR).

3. The ATC Training Manager reviews training records and responds promptly.

4. The theoretical exam for the target rating **must be completed** via Moodle before the CPT request.

5. CPT structure:

   - Intro and confirmation of position/rating
   - Practical session (60–120 minutes)
   - Brief break (≤10 minutes)
   - Theoretical questions
   - Result and debrief

6. On failure, the examiner provides reasons and communicates retraining needs to the ATC Training Manager and Training Centre Instructor.

7. Assessments for S2, S3, and C1 must occur in live environments; traffic should be requested via Discord. A Supervisor broadcast may be issued to attract traffic.

8. S1 assessments may use any method (live or sweatbox).

9. If traffic is insufficient, the CPT should be rescheduled or moved to a busier location. Sweatbox may be used at the ATC Training Manager’s discretion.

10. The candidate must provide top-down service on at least one level below their rating (e.g., an S3 must handle TWR along with TMA duties). Examiners may waive this under heavy traffic conditions.
