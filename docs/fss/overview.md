## Overland FSS Operations for Controllers

# INTRODUCTION

This document details the method for operations for Overland FSS Controllers within VATSSA. It is
very important to note that this absolutely does not reflect real world operations at all, but instead
provides a VATSIM method of operations for the control of aircraft within VATSSA. These sectors are
designed so that ATC services can be provided to more VATSIM pilots within the VATSSA region.

# AIRSPACE

There are three overload FSS positions within the Division:
AFRC_FSS (Africa Central Control)
• Covers FLFI, FNAN, FSSS, FWLL, FZZA, HKNA, HTDC and HUEC airspace above FL245.
AFRS_FSS (Africa South Control)
• Covers FACA, FAJA, FBGR, FIMM, FMMM, FQBE, FVHF and FYWH airspace above FL245.
ARFW_FSS (Africa West Control)
• Covers DGAC, DIII, DNKK, FCCC, GLRB, GOOO (incl. Oceanic) and GVSC airspace above FL245.

# CONTROLLING PRACTICES

Within VATSSA there are some procedural sectors. Most notably are Oceanic sectors, but also some
overland sectors, such as FQBE.
For ease of providing services within VATSSA airspace, all airspace can be controlled by Overland FSS
controllers as though the sectors were under radar control. However, a sector must be in a position
where, should the relevant FIR controller come online, traffic can be handed to them in a non-radar
environment as appropriate. Therefore, the use of direct routes within non-radar airspace should be
avoided, and any radar headings utilised should be able to be resolved within a short space of time.

Where an approach unit is online for an inbound aircraft, you should try to obtain agreement with
the approach controller where traffic is transferred to the Approach Unit at FL240. The aircraft could
be cleared to descend lower, but transfer of communication should be at, or around FL240.
Departing aircraft should be climbing to FL240, and transfer of communication at, or above FL180.
Voice communication has been enabled throughout the FSS areas. Therefore, both voice and text
are permitted to be used.

# CONTROLLER QUALIFICATIONS

An Overland FSS Endorsement issued by VATSSA must be obtained prior to controlling any of the
above positions within this document. The criteria for obtaining such an endorsement are:

- The controller must hold an ATC rating of C1 or higher
- The controller must have at least 25 hours of enroute controlling prior to obtaining the
  endorsement, 15 of which must be within VATSSA airspace.
- The controller must be an approved controller within VATSSA as a CTR controller.
- An OTS may be requested prior to the endorsement being issued, with a successful
  outcome.

# RADAR COVERAGE

The sectors files have been set with visibility settings which do not interfere with other stations
using the same frequencies as the FSS position. Controllers shall not amend the visibility settings for
the positions.

# TRANSPONDER OPERATION

All aircraft under the control of Overland FSS positions shall display a relevant squawk to that FSS
position. Squawks assigned by ACCs should be amended, and all aircraft MUST be displaying a
discrete FSS squawk. This is due to crossover of squawk assignments across VATSSA.

# SECTOR FILES, ISSUES AND COMMENTS

Any issues or comments regarding the FSS positions should be posted on the VATSSA Discord Server
under AFRX_FSS -> Bugs and Suggestions. The latest sector file release dates will also be available
there, and the sector files can be downloaded by approved FSS controllers from vatssa.com. These
sector files must not be shared with other controllers.

# CONTROLLER CURRENCY

Controllers are expected to operate for at least 1 hour per quarter on a VATSSA Overland FSS
position. Should this not take place, attempt will be made to contact the controller and this may
result in controllers being removed from the approval list.
