It is very important to note that this absolutely does not reflect real world operations at all, but instead provides a VATSIM method of operations for the control of aircraft within VATSSA. These sectors are designed so that ATC services can be provided to more VATSIM pilots within the VATSSA region.</p>"},{"location":"fss/overview/#airspace","title":"AIRSPACE","text":"<p>There are three overload FSS positions within the Division: AFRC_FSS (Africa Central Control) \u2022 Covers FLFI, FNAN, FSSS, FWLL, FZZA, HKNA, HTDC and HUEC airspace above FL245. AFRS_FSS (Africa South Control) \u2022 Covers FACA, FAJA, FBGR, FIMM, FMMM, FQBE, FVHF and FYWH airspace above FL245. ARFW_FSS (Africa West Control) \u2022 Covers DGAC, DIII, DNKK, FCCC, GLRB, GOOO (incl. Oceanic) and GVSC airspace above FL245.</p>"},{"location":"fss/overview/#controlling-practices","title":"CONTROLLING PRACTICES","text":"<p>Within VATSSA there are some procedural sectors. Most notably are Oceanic sectors, but also some overland sectors, such as FQBE. For ease of providing services within VATSSA airspace, all airspace can be controlled by Overland FSS controllers as though the sectors were under radar control. However, a sector must be in a position where, should the relevant FIR controller come online, traffic can be handed to them in a non-radar environment as appropriate. Therefore, the use of direct routes within non-radar airspace should be avoided, and any radar headings utilised should be able to be resolved within a short space of time.</p> <p>Where an approach unit is online for an inbound aircraft, you should try to obtain agreement with the approach controller where traffic is transferred to the Approach Unit at FL240. The aircraft could be cleared to descend lower, but transfer of communication should be at, or around FL240. Departing aircraft should be climbing to FL240, and transfer of communication at, or above FL180. Voice communication has been enabled throughout the FSS areas. Therefore, both voice and text are permitted to be used.</p>"},{"location":"fss/overview/#controller-qualifications","title":"CONTROLLER QUALIFICATIONS","text":"<p>An Overland FSS Endorsement issued by VATSSA must be obtained prior to controlling any of the above positions within this document. The criteria for obtaining such an endorsement are:</p> <ul> <li>The controller must hold an ATC rating of C1 or higher</li> <li>The controller must have at least 25 hours of enroute controlling prior to obtaining the   endorsement, 15 of which must be within VATSSA airspace.</li> <li>The controller must be an approved controller within VATSSA as a CTR controller.</li> <li>An OTS may be requested prior to the endorsement being issued, with a successful   outcome.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"fss/overview/#radar-coverage","title":"RADAR COVERAGE","text":"<p>The sectors files have been set with visibility settings which do not interfere with other stations using the same frequencies as the FSS position.
